This script is designed for automatic video file processing, including background removal from each frame and replacing it with an image or color. Processing can be done using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) if available, or using a Central Processing Unit (CPU). It utilizes the rembg library for background removal, cv2 for frame manipulation, PIL for image processing, and moviepy for audio and video handling.

Functionality:

Background Removal:
Each video frame has its background removed using the rembg library. The background can be replaced with a pre-defined image or a solid color.

GPU or CPU Processing:
If a GPU is available, the processing happens on the GPU, which speeds up the process. Otherwise, the CPU is used for processing.

Video Handling:
The video is extracted and split into frames. After background removal, each frame is saved as a separate file. The frames are then reassembled into the final video.

Audio Integration:
After the video is processed, the original audio from the input video is added back to the output video.

Multithreading:
Videos are processed concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor for efficient handling of multiple videos.
